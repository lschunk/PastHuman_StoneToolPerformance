# PastHuman_StoneToolPerformance
This repository contains six different datasets related to a sequential experiment called "tool function experiment". 
The dataset "EA_Keilmesser" contains edge angle values derived from archaeological artefacts. These values built the base for the experimental samples used within the experiment. "HLC" is the dataset containing the Leeb rebound hardness measurements taken on the experimental samples. The dataset "EA" includes the edge angles of the experimental samples from before the use, after 50, 250, 1000, and 2000 scraping/cutting strokes. The volume and weight changes of all experimental samples from before and after the experiment can be found in "VW". An analysis of the sensor data from the mechanical device (SmartTester) used to perform the sequential experiment is in the dataset "ST". The penetration depth of the experimental samples into the contact material was additionally analysed separately. The respective dataset is the "S.wide".
